// The radius of the surface that the belt runs on (in V1 of the ring) was 168.24mm.
// Belt moves 40mm for one stepper revolution (2mm pitch, 20 teeth) or 32mm for one stepper revolution (2mm pitch, 16 teeth)
// RA wheel is 2 x PI x 168.24mm (V2:180mm) circumference = 1057.1mm (V2:1131mm)
// One RA revolution needs 26.43 (1057.1mm / 40mm) or 33.03 (1057.1mm / 32mm) stepper revolutions (V2: 28.27 (1131mm/40mm)or 35.34 (1131mm/32mm))
// Which means 108245 steps (26.43 x 4096) or 135291 steps (33.03 x 4096) moves 360 degrees (V2: 115812 steps (28.27 x 4096) or 144753 steps (35.34 x 4096))
// So there are 300.1 steps/degree (108245 / 360) or 375.8 (135291 / 360)  (V2: 322 (115812 / 360) or 402.1 (144753 / 360))
