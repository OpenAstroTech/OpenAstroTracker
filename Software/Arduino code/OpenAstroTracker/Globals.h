//
// FEATURE SUPPORT SECTION
//
// Since the Arduino Uno has very little memory (32KB code, 2KB data) all features
// stretch the Uno a little too far. So in order to save memory we allow you to enable 
// and disable features to help manage memory usage.
// If you run the tracker with an Arduino Mega, you can uncomment all the features.
//
// If you would like to drive your OAT mount with only the LCD Shield, 
// you should comment out SUPPORT_SERIAL_CONTROL
//
// If you feel comfortable with configuring the OAT at startup manually, you should comment 
// out SUPPORT_GUIDED_STARTUP (maybe after you've used it for a while you know what to do).
//
// The POI menu can take a little data memory and you may not need it. If not, you can comment
// out SUPPORT_POINTS_OF_INTEREST
//
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// If you do not have a LCD shield on your Arduino Uno, uncomment the line below. This is
// useful if you are always going to run the mount from a laptop anyway.

// If this is commented out you still have a GO menu that has Home and Park.

// Uncomment to support INFO menu that displays various pieces of information about the mount.

// If we are making a headleass (no screen, no keyboard) client, always enable Serial.
