**V1.8.23 - Updates**
- GPS location storage was broken. Fixed.

**V1.8.19 - Updates**
- Azimuth motor control during Polar Alignment was not implemented.
- After confirming Polar Alignment, the display shows slewing activity and no longer switches to the INFO menu.
- Pressing Right Button while slewing home after Polar Alignment now stops the slewing before changing menus.
- Removed some logging

**V1.8.16 - Updates**
- Throttled the INFO display update frequency (it was updating every cycle before).
- Added temperature display when using the Digital Level module
- Made the axis swap for the Digital Level on by default since most people will use the STL in the repo for the holder.

- add different MS modes for DEC slewing/guiding
- add UART "noisefeedback" to config
- hardcoded guidemultipliers for 28BYJ-48 steppers
